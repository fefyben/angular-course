With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all.If you eat asparagus you know what I mean by that).Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them. They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.',
